From the given position, the box should  \nextend 10 degrees to the north east, and 1.5 degrees  \nto the south west.  \n\nThis was a complex observation to analyze.  It appears  \nthat the GRB came out of earth-occult in progress  \nat around 19:13:40 UTC.  The average flux over the  \nfull 90-s observation was 330 mCrab (2-12 keV), but  \nwe only observed the burst for around 20 s.  The   \nmaximum flux may have exceeded 2 Crab.    \n\nThe ASM position passes 5' outside the nominal 0.4deg  \nradius LOCBURST position reported by BATSE.",
